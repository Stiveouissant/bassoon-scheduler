# Bassoon Scheduler
Hi everyone! This is a simple mobile app that I created for my fellow bassoon students to organize our lessons (sometimes Messenger was not enough).

I'm not going to upload any releases as this is a personal project for my friends. I'm only sharing some of the code that I wrote, because maybe someone will be able to learn from it.

The app uses Firebase as the backend so you would need to setup your own Firebase android and iOS project to make this code work. The app is not finished yet, there are some bugs that I would like to fix at some point but the main functions are working.
